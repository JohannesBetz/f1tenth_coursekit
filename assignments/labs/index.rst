Labs
==================

Labs are where most of the learning occurs. This is when students have the chance to take what they learned in lecture and apply it to a given problem. There are 8 labs total. Students have 1 to 1.5 week depending on the lab to complete the assignment.

Labs 1-4 are **INDIVIDUAL** assignments and Labs 5-9 are **GROUP** assignments. Students should be placed in teams of 4 ideally with members that have different skill sets.

.. tip:: Set up a `Piazza page <https://piazza.com/>`_ for the class so students can ask questions freely.

All the code for the labs can be found `here <https://github.com/f1tenth/f110_ros>`_. Each lab folder contains the skeleton code and supplemental code to be distributed to the students as well as the latex source files for the lab handout.

The sections below have information for each lab.
