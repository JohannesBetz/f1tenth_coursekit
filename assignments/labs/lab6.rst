Lab 6 - Pure Pursuit
======================
.. note:: This is a **GROUP** assignment and is part of :ref:`Race 2 <doc_race2>`.

.. tip:: Before starting this lab, review the lectures on **Pure Pursuit** to ensure you are familiar with the material.

| **Goals:**
| The objective of this lab is to give you working experience with a powerful SLAM package, Cartographer, and with a basic yet well-behaved trajectory planner: the Pure Pursuit algorithm.

| **Learning Outcomes:**
| The following fundamental should be understood by the students upon completion of this lab:

	* SLAM
	* Cartographer
	* Pure Pursuit algorithm

**Required Skills:** ROS, Python/C++

**Allotted Time:** 1.5 week

**Latex Source Code:** `Github Repository <https://github.com/f1tenth/f110_ros/tree/master/pure_pursuit>`_

| **Deliverables:**
| Submit the following as ``groupnumber_lab6.zip`` (replace ``number`` with your group number)

	#. A ROS Package by the name of: ``groupnumber_pure_pursuit``. **Make sure it compiles before you submit after changing the package name.**
	#. The map of Levine loop you made with Cartographer (``.pgm`` and ``.yaml``)
	#. The recorded ``.csv`` file youâ€™ve logged
	#. You will be racing with your pure pursuit code in :ref:`Race 1 <doc_race1>`
