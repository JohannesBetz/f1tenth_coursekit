Lab 4 - Reactive Methods (Follow the Gap)
===========================================
.. note:: This is an **INDIVIDUAL** assignment and is part of :ref:`Race 1 <doc_race1>`.

.. tip:: Before starting this lab, review the lectures on **Reactive Methods** to ensure you are familiar with the material.

| **Goals:**
| In this lab, you will implement a reactive algorithm for obstacle avoidance. While the base starter code defines an implementation of the F1TENTH Follow the Gap Algorithm, you are allowed to submit in C++, and encouraged to try different reactive algorithms or a combination of several. In total, the python code for the algorithm is only about 120 lines.

| **Learning Outcomes:**
| The following fundamental should be understood by the students upon completion of this lab:

	* Reactive methods for obstacle avoidance

**Required Skills:** ROS, Python/C++

**Allotted Time:** 1 week

**Latex Source Code:** `Github Repository <https://github.com/f1tenth/f110_ros/tree/master/reactive_methods>`_

| **Deliverables:**
| Submit the following as ``studentname_lab4.zip`` (replace ``studentname`` with your name)

	#. Your package named ``studentname_reactive.zip`` including the ``reactive_gap_follow.py`` node,. **Make sure it compiles before you submit after changing the package name.**
	#. Make a youtube video of your reactive method around the Levine Loop in the simulator. Add this link to a text file named ``studentname_reactive_video.txt``
	#. Make a youtube video of it making its way around the custom map we will provide to you. Add this link to a text file named ``studentname_reactive_video.txt``
