Lecture 3 - Automatic Emergency Braking
==========================================

**Overview:** 
	This lecture goes over the importance of safety when working with autonomous systems. When is a system "safe enough" to deploy? In this lecture, you will learn about how Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) works in today's vehicle as well as methods for gathering information about the outside world in order for the vehicle to respond to it appropriately. Once the vehicle has acquired real world data and reacts to its situation accordingly, how do we measure how "safe" the reaction is?

**Topics Covered:**
	-	Autonomatic Emergency Braking (AEB)
	-	Range Sensors for Autonomous Vehicles
	-	Working with Laser Scan Data
	-	Measuring Safety
