Syllabus
==================
This is a semester long course. However, you can modify it to fit a quarter system or less by simply picking and choosing from the set of lectures and topics.

The course is taught in a "clab" style (classroom + lab). Classes are held twice a week, each session is 80 minutes long.

	* 60 minutes lecture
	* 20 minutes tutorial/lab work

Labs are completed outside of class time. Note that some lectures are shorter than others.
