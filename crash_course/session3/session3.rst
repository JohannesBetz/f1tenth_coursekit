.. note::
  We assume you already have Ubuntu and ROS running on your **Pit/Host** laptop. You should also have already gone through :ref:`Session 1 <doc_session1>` and :ref:`Session 2 <doc_session2>` of this Crash Course.

This session is sequential and builds on the sections before it so you must go through each section in order.
