Session 2
==================

.. attention::
  We assume you already have Ubuntu and ROS running on your **Pit/Host** laptop. If not, then you must go through `Getting Started > System Configuration > 1. Pit/Host Setup <https://f1tenth.github.io/build.html>`_. You should also have already gone through :ref:`Session 1 <doc_session1>` of this Crash Course.

In Session 2, you will learn how to use the sensors on the car and control it. This session is sequential and builds on the sections before it so you must go through each section below in order.
