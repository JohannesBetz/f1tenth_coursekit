Introduction
==================

.. important:: 
	You must have gone through at least the entire `Getting Started section of the Build page <http://f1tenth.org/build.html>`_ before starting this crash course. Completing the `Going Forward <http://f1tenth.org/build.html>`_ is a fantastic boost but not required to complete this crash course.

So you have a working F1TENTH vehicle, have a free weekend, and want to go from zero to race-hero ready. Our fun and informative lectures walk you through all the steps to get your car moving, driving straight, making turns, and taking loops. This gets you to the baseline autonomous operation of the vehicle. No prior knowledge is assumed and this is a course meant to make autonomous systems available and accessible.

.. attention:: 
	Some of the hardware in the videos and slides may be outdated but the same concepts apply to the current hardware. We are working to update these video.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate-Advanced

**Approximate Time Investment:** 1 week or 3 weekends

**Skills Required:** Some programming experience (C++ or Python is ideal)



This crash course is divided into 3 sessions. Each session begins with lectures and ends with tutorials and a lab. After all, you will learn by doing and not just by watching.

#. :ref:`Session 1 <doc_session1>` contains the basics of using ROS with the vehicle.
#. :ref:`Session 2 <doc_session2>` goes through the sensing and control.
#. :ref:`Session 3 <doc_session3>` teaches mapping and localization.
